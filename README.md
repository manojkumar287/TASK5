# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. 
The objective is to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

The analysis focuses on understanding the influence of features such as gender, age, ticket class, and embarkation port on survival rates.

## Files Included
- Titanic_eda.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing full EDA workflow, visualizations, and insights.
- Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf: A detailed 3-page PDF summarizing the key findings from the notebook.
- README.md: Project description and instructions.

## Key Findings
- Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
- Passengers from higher ticket classes (1st class) survived more frequently.
- Younger passengers (children) had a better chance of survival compared to older passengers.
- Embarkation port showed minor influence on survival probability.
- Missing values in the dataset were handled thoughtfully, especially in 'Age' and 'Cabin' columns.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Open the Titanic_eda.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute the cells step-by-step to reproduce the analysis.
3. Alternatively, refer to the Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf for a condensed view of the findings.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive look at factors influencing survival on the Titanic, serving as a foundation for future predictive modeling tasks.
